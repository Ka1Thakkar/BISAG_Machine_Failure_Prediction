## Machine Failure Predicition Model

● Machine Learning model for predictive maintenance, enabling anticipation of machine failures 10 days in advance with an accuracy of
94.6%. This facilitates proactive adjustments to prevent downtime and ensure smooth machine operation. <br /> <br />
● Implemented anomaly detection using Mahalanobis Distance Method for efficient outlier identification. <br /> <br />
● Employed Bi-LSTM with attention mechanism for time series analysis, capturing temporal dependencies in the data. Successfully transitioned to
Transformer architecture to model complex temporal relationships and enhance forecasting accuracy.
